### Jie Wu

- I am now leading bioinformatics activities at [Accent Therapeutics](https://accenttx.com), where I have built bioinformatics infrastructure from scratch to support analysis across all programs
- Between 2016 and 2021, I was a senior scientist at Philips Research, working on all kinds of genomics/precision medicine relevant topics
- Before I joined Philips, I was a bioinformatics scientist at the [BioMicro Center at MIT](http://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter). I helped dozens of labs at MIT on bioinformatics and data analysis
- I got my Ph.D. in [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://www.cshl.edu) and [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/). My major is [computational biology](http://compbio.ams.sunysb.edu/). My thesis work mainly focused on NGS (specifically RNA-seq and Splicing) data analysis.

### Summary

- 20 years experience in bioinformatics, 15 years experience in genomics and next-generation sequencing data analysis
- Capable of establishing bioinformatics infrastructure and platform from scratch
- Developed two programs ([SpliceTrap](http://rulai.cshl.edu/splicetrap/) & [OLego](http://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/OLego)) for NGS data analysis
- Skilled in Perl, C++, R, and Shell scripting in Linux
- Background in physics, biology, and mathematics
