# Jie Wu

- I led bioinformatics activities at [Accent Therapeutics](https://accenttx.com), where I built bioinformatics infrastructure from scratch to support analysis across all programs
- Between 2016 and 2021, I was a senior scientist at Philips Research, working on all kinds of genomics/precision medicine relevant topics
- Before I joined Philips, I was a bioinformatics scientist at the [BioMicro Center at MIT](https://bmcwiki.mit.edu/index.php/BioMicroCenter). I helped dozens of labs at MIT on bioinformatics and data analysis
- I got my Ph.D. in [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://www.cshl.edu) and [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/). My major is computational biology. My thesis work mainly focused on NGS (specifically RNA-seq and Splicing) data analysis

# Summary

- Demonstrated expertise in leading bioinformatics, data science and machine learning activities across preclinical and clinical programs
- 20 years experience in bioinformatics, 15 years experience in genomics and next-generation sequencing data analysis,  8 years in healthcare/pharmaceutical industry
- Capable of establishing bioinformatics infrastructure and platform from scratch
- Developed a variety of bioinformatics workflows/frameworks and wrote multiple software
- Track record of 50 [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=mAm07sMxNvQC&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in bioinformatics/oncology/genomics with 10,000+ citations
- Background in physics, biology, and mathematics
