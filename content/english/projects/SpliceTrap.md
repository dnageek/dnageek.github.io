SpliceTrap is a statistical tool for quantifying exon inclusion ratios in paired-end RNA-seq data, with broad applications in the study of alternative splicing. SpliceTrap estimates exon inclusion levels using a Bayesian inference approach. For each exon, it quantifies the extent to which it is included, skipped, or affected by size variations due to alternative 3’/5’ splice sites or intron retention. Additionally, SpliceTrap can quantify alternative splicing within a single cellular condition, without requiring a background set of reads.
