[OLego](http://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/OLego) is a program specifically designed for de novo spliced mapping of mRNA-seq reads. OLego adopts a multiple-seed-and-extend scheme and does not rely on a separate external mapper. It achieves high sensitivity of junction detection by using very small seeds (12â€“14 nt), efficiently mapped using the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and FM-index. This approach also makes it particularly sensitive for discovering small exons. OLego is implemented in C++ with full support for multithreading, enabling fast processing of large-scale data.
