At [Accent Therapeutics](https://accenttx.com), I established a comprehensive bioinformatics infrastructure from the ground up to support all pre-clinical and clinical stage programs. This platform enables key activities such as target identification and evaluation, mechanism of action studies, disease biology research, translational medicine, and clinical trial design. Key features include:

- **Computing Environment:** Provisioned scalable and flexible AWS based cloud resources for storage and computation, balancing limited IT support with evolving bioinformatics needs while optimizing for cost
- **Omics Platform:** Developed both standard (RNA-Seq, WES, WGS) and highly customized pipelines (Splicing focused, Cut&TAG, etc.) that are reproducible, trackable, and scalable, enabling robust multi-omics analyses across diverse research projects
- **Database:** Consolidated cell line and PDX data from multiple public and propreitary sources into a unified database, facilitating efficient data retrieval and biomarker analysis
- **Data Science Platform:** Implemented data science tools and frameworks to support biomarker discovery and exploration with machine learning and statistical modeling
