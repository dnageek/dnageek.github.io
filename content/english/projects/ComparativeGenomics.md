Together with Kartik Shah from Love Lab at MIT, we assembled, annotated and compared three yeast strains. The study identifed major genomic rearrangements, a novel linear plasmid in K. phaffii, and 35 non-synonymous mutations in the industrial strain GS115. Deep RNA-Seq under diverse growth conditions revealed gene expression dynamics related to metabolism, secretion, and stress responses. Using co-expression analysis and functional enrichment, the study mapped regulatory networks and metabolic pathways. These comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic resources provide a solid foundation for improving strain engineering and optimizing recombinant protein production systems.
